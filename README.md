# Employee Attrition and Department Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting employee attrition and department using a multi-output neural network. The dataset comprises various attributes of employees, such as age, daily rate, distance from home, education, job satisfaction, and more. The neural network shares hidden layers between two output branches: one for predicting employee attrition and the other for predicting the department.
